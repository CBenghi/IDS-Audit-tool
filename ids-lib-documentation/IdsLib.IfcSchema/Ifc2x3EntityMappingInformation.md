# Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation class

Mapping information for an entity mapping from an IFC4 class to the equivalent IFC2x3 class and type, as documented by buildingSMART in the ifc2x3-occurrence-type-mapping-table.md file. For example, the definition of an IDS applicability facet with entity `IfcFilter`, should result in the identification of all `IfcFlowTreatmentDevice` in the model that are associated with a type `IfcFilterType`.

```csharp
public class Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation
```

## Public Members

| name | description |
| --- | --- |
| [Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation](Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation/Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation.md)(…) | Initializing constructor for the mapping information, with trimming of the input strings |
| [IdsEntity](Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation/IdsEntity.md) { get; } | Entity name as identified by the IDS file (not a valid IFC2x3 entity name) |
| [IfcEntity](Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation/IfcEntity.md) { get; } | Entity name of the IFC occurrences in the IFC2x3 schema (valid IFC2x3 entity name). Filters need to include the type, so that only occurrences belonging to type [`IfcEntityType`](./Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation/IfcEntityType.md) are included in the mapping. |
| [IfcEntityType](Ifc2x3EntityMappingInformation/IfcEntityType.md) { get; } | Type name of the IFC occurrences in the IFC2x3 schema (valid IFC2x3 entity type name). |
