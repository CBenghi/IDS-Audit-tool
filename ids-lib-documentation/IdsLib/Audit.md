# Audit class

Main static class for invoking the audit functions. If you wish to audit a single file, the best entry point is [`Run`](./Audit/Run.md). This method allows you to run audits on the provided stream. For more complex auditing scenarios (e.g. those used by the tool), some automation can be achieved with [`Run`](./Audit/Run.md). Both APIs provide a return value that can be interpreted to determine if errors have been found. For more detailed feedback on the specific location of issues encountered, you must pass an ILogger interface, and collect events.

```csharp
public static class Audit
```
